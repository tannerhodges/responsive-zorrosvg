  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Based on https://gist.github.com/basecode/3241579</li>
    <li>Turns out we don't need this extra `feMerge`. It's just a timing issue with the render cycle.</li>
    <li>`switch`</li>
    <li>`foreignObject x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="200%" requiredFeatures="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#Extensibility"`</li>
    <li>Q: Does inline width affect the rendering? Or is it just different images loading based on connection speed?</li>
    <li>A: Looks like it's the correct image. For some reason we're still getting a pixelated image, though.</li>
    <li>From the DevTools Timeline, the image is decoded and rendered once the first byte is returned. Nothing tells Chrome to repaint after the image is fully downloaded, so you get the pixelated first byte version. Note: the full quality image is repainted once you resize the page.</li>
    <li>The first byte image is most noticeable when referencing an external image. If you load a local image immediately, the problem is resolved.</li>
    <li>I really wish DevTools could record Network and Timeline data simultaneously.</li>

    <li>For whatever reason, it looks Chrome is downloading this image despite the `switch` statement. And Firefox loads the default `src` no matter what. So does Safari. And IE doesn't support `picture` or `srcset` at all, so we need a fallback for that. Woof.</li>
